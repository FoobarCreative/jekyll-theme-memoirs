Make every second count!


Configure unlimited timers to keep you on task and organised, add them to your Home Screen as widgets so they are only a swipe away.


Quickly configure your timers duration and number of sets (infinite repeats is possible!), choose a descriptive name, and thats a great start.


For bonus points, edit the theme, or select one from the theme gallery, so it matches your Home Screen aesthetic.
