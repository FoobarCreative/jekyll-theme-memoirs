Swipe2delete is your new best friend for cleaning up your camera roll, and it’s actually fun!

Sure, there are other apps out there that promise to help you declutter your photos. But let’s be real, they are either too complicated or just... boring. We wanted something simple, enjoyable, and super efficient. And thats how Swipe2delete was born!

So, how does it work? Easy: swipe right to keep a photo and swipe left to delete it. If you have second thoughts, no worries! Tap to undo and keep that snap. When you’re done with a batch, get a final look at what’s staying and what’s going, make any last-minute changes, and voila, mission complete!

Why month by month? Because we like our memories neat and organized! Swipe2delete helps you tackle your photos one month at a time, so it’s not overwhelming. And once you’ve finished a month, it gets checked off your list (but don’t worry, you can always go back if you want). Didn’t finish sorting? No biggie! Your progress is saved, with a handy progress wheel showing how much is left.

Your camera roll should be a highlight reel, not a cluttered mess of duplicates, blurry shots, and endless screenshots. With Swipe2delete, it’s all about rediscovering your best moments, without the clutter.
